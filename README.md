# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a project that i learnt from the tutorial of the channel Bro Code on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez
This is a game where you compete against the computer which randomly selects an empty place and plays its turn.
But I found a bug while testing the game which I will post a scerrnshot below, where in the last game I won the game but without actually winning the game.
If you can fix the bug be sure to tag me on the solution. Thanks!
